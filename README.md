### 6.1 ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
The ERD was designed using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to show the relationship between the different entities in the database.

### 6.2 Wireframes
The wireframes were drawn using Balsamic. Both the larger screen and the mobile version were created at the same time. This allowed for a greater design initiative which took into account the overall layout of the website and how I wanted it to look on both screens. The wireframes were used throughout the design of the website and went through various iterations until I was happy with the final product.

### 6.3 Colour Palette
The colour palette chosen is the typical colour scheme of the rock and metal scene: red, white and black. However, I change the 'white' for a softer shade of light grey (#F5F5F5) so that it wasnâ€™t so stark on the eyes and doesn't cause blurring and bleeding into the black or red. The red (#F50000) was chosen to reduce the brightness of the red and a dark grey (#5C5C5C) was chosen for the navigation bar so that it had prominance on the black background. 

Finally, the logo was designed using gold (#D4AF37) on a black (#000000) background in fitting with, and to play on, the religious iconography taken in humour for the website.

The colours chosen from [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) were:
